The key difference lies in **when and how the YouTube IFrame API is loaded**, which affects how the `rel` parameter is processed.

## The Core Difference

**First Code (Direct iframe):**
- `rel=0` is applied when the iframe is initially created
- YouTube's algorithm may still show some recommendations (especially from the same channel)

**Second Code (API-loaded iframe):**
- `rel=0` is applied **after** the YouTube API is fully loaded
- The API has more control and can more effectively disable recommendations

## Why This Happens

1. **Direct iframe approach** sometimes shows "same channel" recommendations because:
   - YouTube's algorithm considers same-channel videos as "related content" rather than "recommendations"
   - The enforcement of `rel=0` is less strict for channel-owned content

2. **API approach** provides:
   - More precise control over player behavior
   - Better enforcement of privacy and recommendation settings
   - The API applies settings at a different stage in player initialization

## Solutions for Your First Code

If you want to use the direct iframe method but avoid recommendations:

**Option 1: Add `playsinline` parameter**
```html
<iframe 
  src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NzKSVd4Dh8o?rel=0&modestbranding=1&controls=1&playsinline=1"
  allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

**Option 2: Use additional parameters**
```html
<iframe 
  src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NzKSVd4Dh8o?rel=0&modestbranding=1&controls=1&fs=1&playsinline=1"
  allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

**Option 3: Enhanced API approach (recommended)**
```javascript
function onYouTubeIframeAPIReady() {
  player = new YT.Player('player', {
    videoId: 'NzKSVd4Dh8o',
    playerVars: {
      controls: 1,
      rel: 0,
      modestbranding: 1,
      fs: 1,
      playsinline: 1
    },
    events: {
      onReady: () => { console.log("Player Ready"); }
    }
  });
}
```

The API method is generally more reliable for controlling YouTube player behavior, which is why you're seeing the difference in recommendation behavior.
